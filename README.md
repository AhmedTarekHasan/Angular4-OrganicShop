# Angular4-OrganicShop

This is the practice of a great course by the name [The Complete Angular Course: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-angular-master-class) authored by [Mosh Hamedani](https://programmingwithmosh.com/courses/).

The course consists of 376 lectures in 29.5 hours playing time videos. It is a great course which I really recommend for those who want to learn Angular 2+, not only learn it, but also have advanced knowledge of it.

This is the certificate I got after successfully completing the course.
